This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## What is this project

This is intended as a page for an automation company.

There is a contact page where users can submit their request for a job
opportunity.

Simulating a page intended for the company RH department there is a dashboard behind
a login screen, or by pressing the bypass button, with all the submissions where they can be edited and deleted. T

In the dashboard there are versions for a server side table and a client side
table, still on the work.
